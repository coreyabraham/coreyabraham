## Hey all! Welcome to my GitHub Profile!
### Brief
This is where I work on all of my own personal pet projects as well as the profile I use to contribute to other projects I'm in association with / tasked to work on, this profile isn't exactly the most expansive, nor professional, though I hope it is at least of some use to you.
Thanks for reading and I hope to see you soon!

### Background
I'm a Games Programmer who started out young with a passion for Video Games and thus, a growing interest in creating said games as a future career. As such I started learning the "Roblox Studio" program which familiarized me to Games Development via a common ground across all of development, a Games Engine. Sure it may have not been the industry standard, however that's where I am now;

I'm currently a University Student at the [Academy of Interactive Entertainment](https://aie.edu.au/) completing a Two Year Course in Games Programming, here's the basis of what I've learned from the course!

- C# and C++ Programming
- Custom Engine Development (Via C++) | [Typical Custom Engine](https://github.com/coreyabraham/typical-custom-engine)
- [Unity Engine](https://unity.com/)

Along with these, I've learned the following across my journey up until this point, I may not be the _the most_ flexible with these, though they may certainly be of use!

- Lua
- Python
- HTML
- CSS
- Javascript
- [Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org/)

### Conclusion
Thanks for visiting my profile and I hope to see you soon, see ya!
